    :description: Configuration for the ESP32 PSRAM platform for ESPHome.
    :image: psram.svg

This component enables and configures PSRAM if/when available on ESP32 modules/boards.
It is automatically loaded and enabled by components that require it.

PSRAM is only available on the ESP32.

    # Example configuration entry
    psram:
      mode: octal
      speed: 80MHz

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **mode** (*Optional*): Defines the operating mode the PSRAM should utilize. One of ``quad`` (default) or ``octal``.
- **speed** (*Optional*, int): The speed at which the PSRAM should operate. One of ``40MHz`` (default), ``80MHz`` or ``120MHz``.
- **enable_ecc** (*Optional*, bool): For octal mode, enable ECC (Error Correction Code) for the PSRAM (default is off.)
  ECC is a method of detecting and correcting single-bit errors in memory. It will reduce the available PSRAM size and speed by
  1/16th, but also increases the rated temperature range of some ESP32 modules.

Restrictions
------------
* Not all ESP32 modules have PSRAM available. If you are unsure, consult the datasheet of your module.
* Not all modules support all modes and speeds.
* 120MHz is not available with octal mode, unless using ESP-IDF and the ``enable_idf_experimental_features`` is enabled
  in the ESP-IDF platform :ref:`esp32-advanced_configuration`.
* If you choose the wrong mode for your board, the PSRAM will not work.
* Configuring an unsupported speed will usually result in the PSRAM running at the default speed.
* Typically on ESP32-S3 modules, a 2MB PSRAM will use quad mode, while 8 or 16MB will use octal mode.
