    :description: Instructions for setting up a USB Host UART interface on an ESP32 in ESPHome

This component allows an ESP32-S3 or ESP32-S2 to connect to USB-serial devices. It uses the :doc:`/components/usb_host`
component to connect to the device.

Currently supported devices are listed in the table below:

    # Example minimal configuration entry
    usb_uart:
      - type: cp210x
        channels:

Configuration variables:
************************

- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The id to use for this component.
- **type** (**Required**, string): The type of USB-serial device to connect to. One of ``ch34x``, ``ch340``, ``esp_jtag``, ``stm32_vcp``, ``cdc_acm``, ``cp210x``.
- **channels** (**Required**, list): A list of channels to configure.
- **vid** (*Optional*, int): The vendor ID of the device. Use 0 as a wildcard. Each type has a default VID which will be overridden if this is set.
- **pid** (*Optional*, int): The product ID of the device. Use 0 as a wildcard. Each type has a default PID which will be overridden if this is set.

Setting both ``vid`` and ``pid`` to 0 will match any device.

Channel configuration options:
******************************

- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): An id to assign to the channel. This id may be used anywhere a ``uart`` component is required.
- **baud_rate** (**Required**, int): The baud rate to use for the channel. This is optional (and ignored) for the ``stm32_vcp``, ``esp_jtag`` and ``cdc_acm`` types.
- **buffer_size** (*Optional*, int): The size of the buffer to use for the channel. Defaults to 256 bytes.
- **stop_bits** (*Optional*, float): The number of stop bits to use. Defaults to 1. Other options are 1.5 and 2.
- **data_bits** (*Optional*, int): The number of data bits to use in the range 5-8. Defaults to 8.
- **parity** (*Optional*, string): The parity to use. One of ``NONE``, ``EVEN``, ``ODD``, ``MARK`` and ``SPACE``. Defaults to ``NONE``.
- **dummy_receiver** (*Optional*, boolean): If set to true, the channel will consume any data received. This is useful for debugging purposes. Defaults to false.
- **debug** (*Optional*, boolean): If set to true, the channel will log all data sent and received. Defaults to false.

Device types
************

The ``cdc_acm`` type is a generic USB CDC ACM (Abstract Control Model) device. This is a common USB device class for serial communication.
This driver does not strictly enforce the CDC-ACM configuration specification, so it may work with devices that do not properly implement that specification. It expects to find a single interrupt endpoint, a single bulk in endpoint, and a single bulk out endpoint.
The ``cdc_acm``, ``esp_jtag`` and ``stm32_vcp`` types do not support changing baud rate, stop bits or number of data bits, as they implement a virtual channel not typically associated with a physical UART.
