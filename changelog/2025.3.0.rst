Our second release of 2025 is a bit smaller -- Jesse is away, so we are a bit short-staffed. ðŸ˜…

Even so, we do still have a few new additions (as above), so we thought we'd proceed with a release just the same.
Of note, the long-awaited :doc:`/components/sensor/ld2450` has landed; as there are now a few products available with
this sensor, it seemed about time to get it baked in. That said, I'll keep it short. Happy hacking!
