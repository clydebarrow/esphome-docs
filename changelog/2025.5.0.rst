Packet Transport
----------------

The :doc:`/components/packet_transport/index` has been added to allow ESPHome devices to directly communicate with each other.
There are two platforms available in this release: :doc:`/components/packet_transport/uart` and :doc:`/components/packet_transport/udp`.


HTTP Request
------------

The :doc:`/components/http_request` actions have had the ``headers`` config variable renamed to ``request_headers`` in order to differentiate
it from the new ``collect_headers`` config variable allowing you to collect and access the response headers in automations.


ATM90E32
--------

The :doc:`/components/sensor/atm90e32` component has a few changes to be written about...
